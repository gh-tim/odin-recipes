My first HTML project encompassing all the HTML basics I've learnt from The Odin Project

This current project is a basic website for food recipes. It will include an index page, sub pages, text, pictures, and links
This project will also be revisited once I've acquired knowledge of CSS to further improve it stylistically
Skills I will demonstrate in this HTML project: ability to build a basic website from HTML, make proficient use of appropriate tags and elements, make clear and concise commit messages
