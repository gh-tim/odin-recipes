            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

        </ul>

        <br>
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F. Add the tomatoes to a baking pan, drizzle with 2 tbsp of olive oil and then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for about 30 minutes or until the tomatoes start to char.</li> 
            <li>Add the tomatoes with the skin on to a food processor and 1 cup of the vegetable broth. Blend until tomatoes are smooth.</li>
            <li>In a heavy soup pot, heat the remaining olive oil and melt the butter over medium-heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent.</li>
            <li>Stir in the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until aromatic.</li>
            <li>Add the fresh basil, thyme and stir. Sprinkle the flour over the onion mixture and stir again. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Stir in the remaining 1 cup of vegetable broth or whisk if necessary to remove any flour lumps.</li> 
            <li>Next, pour the blended tomatoes and stir. Finally, stir in the brown sugar, smoked paprika, and if needed, season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Let the soup simmer uncovered for 20 – 30 minutes. Serve with grated parmesan cheese and toasted bread.</li>
