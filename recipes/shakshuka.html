        <p>
           <strong>Shakshuka</strong> is a Maghrebi dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, 
           peppers, onion and garlic, commonly spiced with cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shakshuka may be at <em>the apex of eggs-for-dinner recipes</em>, though in Israel it is breakfast food, a bright, spicy start to the day with a 
            pile of pita or challah served on the side. (It also makes excellent brunch or lunch food.) <strong>It’s a one-skillet recipe!</strong>
            First you make that sauce, which comes together fairly quickly on top of the stove, then you gently crack each of the eggs into the pan, 
            nestling them into the sauce. The pan is moved into the oven to finish. 
        </p>    

        <p>
            Shakshuka originated in North Africa, and like many great dishes there are as many versions as there are cooks who have embraced it. 
            This one strays from more traditional renditions by adding crumbled feta cheese, which softens into creamy nuggets in the oven’s heat.
