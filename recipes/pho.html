            This South Vietnamese style pho brings comfort with every sip and slurp. It's a <strong>restorative, richly seasoned broth</strong> ladled 
            over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and served with a host of crisp, tangy, spicy, sweet, and fragrant garnishes.

            <ol>
                <li>Place the beef bones in a 9-quart pot. Season with salt, and fill pot with 2 gallons of water. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Put onions and unpeeled ginger on a foil-lined roasting pan and broil until onion and ginger are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let onions and ginger to cool slightly. Chop onions. Peel and slice ginger.</li>
                <li>Skim fat from surface of broth, and add oxtail, daikon, and charred onions.</li>
                <li>Tie anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, peppercorns and charred ginger in cheesecloth; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 tsp. salt.</li>
                <li>Simmer over medium-low heat at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Strain broth. Discard spices and bones.</li>
                <li>Reserve meat from bones for other uses, if desired. Taste broth and add additional salt as needed. Chill overnight.</li>
                <li>Skim fat from top of chilled broth. Bring broth to a boil; reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Cook rice noodles in boiling water according to package directions until soft, but not mushy. Cut sirloin into paper-thin slices.</li>
                <li>Divide noodles among bowls (1 1/2 cups per bowl). Top each with a few raw sirloin slices. Ladle boiling broth to cook beef and cover noodles.</li>
